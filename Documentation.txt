part2 changes:

1. we added ub_test
2. we add HLP. 
To implement HLP, we add the following two functions in sched.c

//promote current task's priority to 0
void promote_cur_task()
//if current task hold no lock, degrade it's priority to 
//its native value
void degrad_cur_task()

in mutex_lock, we will call promote_cur_task, and in 
mutex_unlock we will call degrad_cur_task.
